                <p class = "p-about">Hi! <br> My name is Andrew MacEntee, a student at SUNY New Paltz studying to be a Math and Computer Science teacher. I am currently only in my first year of college.
                    When I get out of college with a Masters degree, I plan to teach in a High School, starting with teaching math and also some Computer Science classes. I have always had a keen interest for Computer Science as I have always found it fascinating.
                    <br><br>Some of my hobbies include playing many different sports including soccer, tennis and volleyball. I also enjoy spending time with family and friends, whether that is in person or online.
